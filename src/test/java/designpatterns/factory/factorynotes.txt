What is Factory Pattern?
Factory Pattern is used to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.

Instead of
PaymentStrategy strategy = new CreditCardPayment();
we do
PaymentStrategy strategy = PaymentFactory.getPayment("CARD");

So the client:
❌ Doesn’t know which class is created
✅ Just asks the factory

🎯 Why Do We Need Factory?
if (type.equals("CARD")) {
    return new CreditCardPayment();
} else if (type.equals("UPI")) {
    return new UPIPayment();
}

If you write this everywhere → messy code.
Factory centralizes object creation.
